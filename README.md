# SS-x-MM-Door-Security
I asked the lab boys to bring me a dorm door security system that didn't require my damn keys. They said "Salix, it can't be done."\
\
In a collaboration with Salix Science and Maddy's Mischief, introducing the Biometric Dorm Door Opener! The lab boys couldn't do it but we sure as hell could!\

Now for anyone wondering *why* this had to be built, I will answer that question with another question. Why not!?\
And for anyone wondering *how* this was built, well, that's why you are reading this pretyped message...
